`TileFighterCore.py`
This is the entry point to the application, and will likely be a bit of a mess!
Prototyping is often done in this file before things get factored out to their
own areas.

In theory this should just house the `setup`, `draw`, and event functions like
`keyPressed`, as well as any helper functions made specifically for those
methods.  In practice, this file could contain anything!
